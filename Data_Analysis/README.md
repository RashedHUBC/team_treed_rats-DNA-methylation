## Milestone 1 - Data Preprocessing

### Sanity Checking DNA Methylation (Tony)
[1-Methylation_sanity_check.md](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_treed_rats-DNA-methylation/blob/master/Data_Analysis/1-Methylation_sanity_check.md)
* Motivation
  * Performed sanity checks on DNA methylation data to check if anything funny is happening
* Results
  * Discovered that libraries have low coverage, so decided to pool replicates together
  * Noticed that female libraries have less coverage overall, which may influence results
  * Good that Estradiol and Male samples cluster together
